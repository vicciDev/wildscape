│── main.js
│── runtime.js
│── styles.css
└── assets/
```

This is **not** the source code it is the compiled output ready for hosting.

## **How to Run the App (Local Preview)**

Because this is a production build, you **cannot** use `ionic serve`.

Use any static file server instead:

### **Option 1 Using `Open Live server` (recommended)**
* Install VS Code.
* Install the Open Live Server extension (Ctrl+Shift+X → search → install).
* Open the project folder in VS Code.
* Right-click the index.html file → Open with Live Server (or click Go Live bottom-right).

### **Option 2 Using `serve` (Node.js)**

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s www
```

Preview At:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### **Option 3 Using Python**

```bash
cd www
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Preview at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

### **Option 4 Deploy to Hosting (Not Recomended)**

You can upload the `www` folder to any static hosting:

* **Netlify**
* **Vercel**
* **Firebase Hosting**
* **GitHub Pages**
* **Nginx / Apache**

## **Notes**

* API endpoints already configured before building (environment files are not included in this ZIP).
* This ZIP is for **running** the app not editing or developing it.
* For full source code, request the development repository.
* Some Features are still not fully implimented
