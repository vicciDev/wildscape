# **WildSight**

*A community-powered wildlife sightings platform.*

WildSight is a social platform for wildlife enthusiasts to **log wildlife sightings**, **share photos**, and **connect with a community of nature lovers**. This package contains the **compiled production build** of the WildSight frontend.

## 🦁 **About the App**

WildSight allows users to:

* Record wildlife sightings
* Upload photos
* Tag species and add notes
* Use GPS-based location tagging
* Access posts and community content

---

## 📁 **What’s Included**

This ZIP file contains the **production build** generated by Ionic/Angular.

```
www/
│── index.html
│── main.js
│── runtime.js
│── styles.css
└── assets/
```

This is **not** the source code it is the compiled output ready for hosting.

## 🚀 **How to Run the App (Local Preview)**

Because this is a production build, you **cannot** use `ionic serve`.

Use any static file server instead:

---

### **Option 1 Using `Open Live server` (recommended)**
* Install VS Code.
* Install the Open Live Server extension (Ctrl+Shift+X → search → install).
* Open the project folder in VS Code.
* Right-click the index.html file → Open with Live Server (or click Go Live bottom-right).
### **Option 1 Using `serve` (Node.js)**

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s www
```

Preview At:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### **Option 2 Using Python**

```bash
cd www
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Preview at:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

### **Option 3 Deploy to Hosting (Not Recomended)**

You can upload the `www` folder to any static hosting:

* **Netlify**
* **Vercel**
* **Firebase Hosting**
* **GitHub Pages**
* **Nginx / Apache**

---

## **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**

* Ionic + Angular
